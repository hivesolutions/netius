    Abstract stream class responsible for the representation of
    a "virtual" connection state for situation where multiplexing
    of single connection exists (connections within connections)

    Most of the interface for a stream should be "logically" similar
    to the one defined by a connection.

    A good example of the stream usage is the HTTP2 protocol where
    multiple parallel streams co-exist within a single TCP connection
    allowing huge performance improvements.
