    Top level class for the entry point classes of the multiple

    These classes should contain a series of utilities that facilitate
    the interaction with the Protocol, Event Loop and Transport
    objects (with the end developer in mind).

    Most of the interaction for a simple protocol should be implemented
    using static or class methods, avoiding internal object state and
    instantiation of the concrete Agent class.

    For complex protocols instantiation may be useful to provided extra
